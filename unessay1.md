# The Pyschology of Colors

### Abstract

An uessay about the psychology of colors and how they play an integral role in technology.  

## Colors in everyday objects

Colors can make any subject stand out, whether it would be for paintings to video game graphics. Even combinations of shades and weight can give greyscale the same effect. I know the saying does "don't judge a book by its cover", but I must admit that I have picked up certain books from shelves because their covers look inviting. Colors would make the title and author stand out, but it also serves as a medium to convey the bare minimum about what the book is about. That's what I find intriguing about our use of colors. Throughout the course of human evolution, we've associated colors to a certain aspect of what we believe in. Along with it, they carry a deeper meaning; road signs are painted in yellow, to contrast the blue sky for us to catch better, no smoking signs are in red, to enforce an eye-catching rule. And when reading between the lines, red conveys a sense of danger, therefore making us more alert to interact with the color. Therefore, we can say that colors carry along information, and it can be interpreted in different perspectives. However, this unessay will talk about the use of color's hidden information: on the Internet and in applications. With the upbringing of technology, to what extent does color successfully address the same associations we've given them?

## On the Internet

Colors attract the attention of users and increase brand recognition, memory and participation. They affect our way of thinking and behavior, and therefore marketers can position and use them correctly to gain an advantage over what their target market needs. Colorsâ€™ effects on the marketing & brands side is proven, presenting us with some basic, but important truths related to our perception and buying decisions. 

Correspondingly, we have to consider the effects of colors on users for developing customer-oriented mobile application. Why Are Colors Important For Mobile Apps? A user-friendly interface does not make up the whole story behind front-end application design. Color is an important dimension of the overall design and App Store Optimization. For example, the first thing that get an impression of is the app icon. Just like me, in a sea of applications, I would occasionally pick out one that stood out, regardless of looking just yet to see what it has to offer.
