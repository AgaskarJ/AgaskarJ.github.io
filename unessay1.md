# Norman Doors

### Abstract

An uessay about the Norman Door which analyzes how we interact with everyday objects and its relation to technology. 

## Doors are poorly designed

At the beginning of the year, I was on my way out of Marino center from the front side on Huntington. Its got those huge glass doors that you have to go through twice to get in and out of the building. Yet, if you're like me and you've gone through these doors, they don't make any sense! You would exit one side of the door, get to the other, and it won't let you out in one swift opening, because its positioned from two different spots. 


A so-called “Norman Door” has design elements that give you the wrong usability signals to the point that special signage is needed to clarify how they work. Without signs, a user is left guessing about whether to push or pull, creating needless frustration.
